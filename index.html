<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
  I am a Software Engineer whose ultimate goal is very simple. <i>"Help other developers to get unstuck."</i> By writing blog about things that I got stuck with, I hope that, by reading my blog, it will help them to get unstuck and allow them to quickly resolve the issue that they are having. And, move on to the next big thing! So far, I have written <i>{{ site.posts | size }}</i> of them since Oct, 2016. And for sure, they will keep coming. Check <a href="/blog">them</a> out!
