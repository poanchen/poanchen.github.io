head over to the Azure DevOps Releases to create a new Release based on the latest build. Hit deploy button 
and lay back enjoy the moment.
6. Remember to head over to Webmaster Tools to update the sitemap.xml so that Google will 
index your new blog
7. You are done!!!
```

## Troubleshooting

In case you ran into problem like `/usr/bin/env: node: No such file or directory` when you try to run gulp, this was due to the misnaming convention between nodejs and node. You simply need to run this command to make this error goes away,

```bash
ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node
```
according to https://github.com/nodejs/node-v0.x-archive/issues/3911

In case you ran into problem like `require': cannot load such file -- jekyll-sitemap (LoadError)` when you try to run jekyll server, this was due to the missing jekyll-sitemap in gem. You simply need to run this command to make this error goes away,

```
gem install jekyll-sitemap
```
